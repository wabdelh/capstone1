# Team: Infinite Loop - Baby Tracker

Team Infinite Loop is trying to make an easy and accessible application for parents that will allow them to ensure their baby’s health and schedule. Everyone knows babies are a lot of work. They require constant around the clock care, but how do you really know what they need? Babies can not communicate, so when a baby cries, we are often left wondering why. When this happens most parents go through a checklist of things such as: When were they last fed? When was the last diaper change? Do they need a nap? And much more.

The solution to this is to have an application that will easily record your baby's activities. All the records will be transcribed into an easy to read report that will display overall health and metrics of the baby. This information could range from average bowel movements per week to the number of naps taken in a day. Once averages for your child have been determined they can be compared to a daily number to help easily determine what could be best for your child.
